# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

White-box testing: Control Flow and Data Flow Coverage

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

For the first part of the test design component we measure the adequacy of our test suite using one or more code coverage tools

## Measuring Control Flow Coverage



## Measuring Data Flow Coverage Manually




# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)
